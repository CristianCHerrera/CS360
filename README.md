# CS360
This goal of this application is to take user input and have the ability to view, store, delete, and update the data. It is meant to be a weight loss application that helps users track their daily weight. User is meant to input a goal weight, and if the user grants permission the app will send an SMS notifcation once that goal is reached.

A register, login, add, view, and modify screen were all needed to help the user access all functions of the application and help them be able to use the application for the intended purpose.

I tested the code to ensure it was functional by running the entire code constantly throughout development, in order to make debugging easier since there'd be less new code to look over and fix
